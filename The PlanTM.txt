The Story:
- Gourmet Guy in the top of Star Temple, he snatched the Star Rod after the Star Spirits returned it
- He wished to be strong enough to defeat Mario, but the Star Spirits empowered Mario to be equal, nullifying the effect, so Mario goes up and initiates a fight with him
- Gourmet Guy is now the size of a normal Shy Guy

The Fight:
- Just kinda memey
- If you jump on him he says you are attacking twice (It's like having two attacks in one attack!) and then let's you only do 1 bounce ever
- If you hammer him he says that the fight will end in no time if you deal that much damage and makes the hammer do only 1 damage
- Starts off as normal Shy Guy, then transforms into Gourmet Guy, then into Anti Gourmet Guy (Phase 1 - 3 respectively)
